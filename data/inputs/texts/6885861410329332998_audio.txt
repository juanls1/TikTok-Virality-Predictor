turn in my man card check it out homie I'm going to explain to you how it works as a man in the military especially if you go any type of Special Operations you're moving around like crazy and then even when I got out I continue to move cuz I did my undergrad in one city and now do my doctor and another city so strategically I stay alive and also there's a bunch of other man card rules I hear about all the time like drinking beer like beer is actually the most manly thing you could do you cannot listen to any of these Society norms and do what you think is right and what you enjoy doing
