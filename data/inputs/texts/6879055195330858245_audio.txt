this is just 474 lb my relatively light single from the other night and this is 89 lb below my best but it's not about the weight on the bar it's more dealing with an injury or getting back into the gym after dealing with an injury always appreciate the little victories this is the first time in a while where I had absolutely no pain while squatting and it's a happy as I've been for squat session in a very very long time so the way it's not going to come back immediately the important thing is how's your comfort level in the gym how's your pain level in the gym if it starts to dissipate over time then you're on the right track just take it day by day
