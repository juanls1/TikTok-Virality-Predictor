my favorite part of political conversation is that people always assume that I've always been liberal do you know what Trump's largest voter base is and has been white Evangelical Christians do you know what I was in 2016 yeah I didn't vote but if I had it would have been for Trump and my proud of that no but you know what I am proud of demonstrating the ability over the past four years to learn and grow and to reassess what I value and adjust my actions accordingly so when I say I have zero tolerance for Trump voters it's not because I can't empathize or because I don't have an understanding of what it's like it's because I do because I was there and I couldn't even tolerate it for my own sake I'm not tolerating it for yours
