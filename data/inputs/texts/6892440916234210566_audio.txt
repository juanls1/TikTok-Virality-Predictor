hey Tim who hurt you this year started talking to somebody else flew across the country twice to see this person when covid hit only for things not to work out with children had to distance myself from people who I thought could call friend it's just the punches whenever I'm dealing with things like this because my dad he had a company going under he then got another job at a place he didn't like left that job started his own company again and now he's a happy she's ever been my mom 30 years ago came to this country illegally had to track through the desert nearly died there almost got deported when I was two and had to fight for her citizenship which thankfully she has his day and they both had to race me which I'm a handful but those are real trials and tribulations a couple people hurting your feelings it's not that deep it's a drop in the ocean
