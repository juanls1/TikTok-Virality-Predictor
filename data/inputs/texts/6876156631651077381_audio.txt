I got I got the stress acne because I'm stressed and because I don't think I've gotten more than 3 hours of sleep in like 4 weeks honestly so I'm all cracked up and I'm all stressed up and stuff and it's just great so when I get stressed I get that and I get that and I get all that and I get stuff all over my shoulder it's great sick sick sick that's just one of the things I hate about my body acne
