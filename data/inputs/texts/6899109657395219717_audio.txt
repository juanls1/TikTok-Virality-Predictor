George Floyd was literally murdered right in the middle of the street because he tried to use a counterfeit $20 bill that turned out to be real and you just spent 20 minutes at Walmart trying to use a fake credit card for tick tock skit I can't help but notice that nothing happened to you I feel like it was a term for that this video doesn't exist it was actually a really good example of it nobody's ever in any way the white person can just walk into Walmart and steal something but apparently we can pretend like we're committing credit card fraud not even get a funny look
