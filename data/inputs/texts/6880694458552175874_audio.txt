I already did a video on this exercise but I wanted to provide a comparison to better illustrate my point firstly this arm angle is in line with the muscle fibers of the lats and it keeps his calculator protracted in your arm in front of you which means the loudest work in relatively independently secondly the movement is initiated with the upper arm not the scapula so does effectively entirely a lot movement anything that involves bringing the humerus wrap around the body against resistance if you're trying to build a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle back the light doesn't do as much once your elbow is behind your body like with the traditional here at this point like the Terry's lowering most of the resistance
