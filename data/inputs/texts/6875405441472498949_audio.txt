why do metal plates feel heavier than nonmetal plates well there's two reasons for this if we're talking about you know strictly traditional cast iron plates they are somewhat cheaply manufactured because they don't have to go through a calibration process so there could be a plus or minus 5 difference in weight so 45 lb play could easily weigh anywhere from 40 to 50 lbs and I've even seen more exchange with like 53 lbs so I could be one reason number two if we're talking about steel calibrated plates would I use for power lifting probably because it is a smaller plate there's not as much surface area being covered so everything is you know condensed into that one surface area now if we're talking you know rubber plates you know what they use in CrossFit for example because there is more weight distribution or rather more surface area for the way to distribution so we'll see if 4500 for example it has a potential to feel a little like less heavy or a little bit lighter than steel calibrated for example but at the end of the day wait wait wait
