lateral raises without using too much traffic to fix that try fully protracting your shoulders and flexing your laps before and throughout the entire set as I do here this should reduce trap involvement and mitigate the movement of the shoulder blades make sure you don't allow your shoulders to roll forward though in other words your traps shouldn't be flexed some other pieces of advice or to try using lighter weight cheating less with the movement and doing one I'm at a time until you can develop that proper my muscle connection I also wouldn't recommend chasing Progressive overload with lateral raise variations and focusing more on metabolic fatigue during each set
