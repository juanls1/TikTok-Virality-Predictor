I kind of avoided this question before because when you think about it that is a very personal question because there are some people out there that will get a little bit embarrassed depending on what their occupation is and they might not be happy with who they currently stand in life so I will tiptoe around the topic like this currently as a senior level investment accounting analyst I make close to six figures gross keep in mind I spent the last few years paying off all my student loans and my car I'm pretty much debt free now now with projections with apparel and the gym which will be happening next year I know that I will be making six figures a year because when you invest in yourself you obviously want to be as confident as possible and between the three of us that being me Ricky and Joe we know that the gym is going to be very successful because this is something we're really passionate about and on top of that I'll still have a job while running the gym so hope that answers your question
