so a lot of people have been commenting on my recent duet that their metabolisms are so fast that they can't gain weight no matter what or that they have to resort to eating crappy High calf food to see any weight gain at all without question some people have a crazy Fast Metabolism but I'm inclined to believe that most of these people probably don't know what is realistic to expect when intelligently bulking or what is required firstly you likely not going to gain quality weight as fast as you think so be patient it takes more than a couple of weeks secondly if you think you have a fast food isn't start setting alarms every two or three hours to eat make sure you hit your protein goal and then shove white rice and sweet potato in your face like it's your job when I had three knee surgeries and one month and second year I lost 35 pounds when I was trying to get that way back at 8 Mi a day every two hours on a schedule and it's not about the size of the meals it's about how much food you eat throughout the entirety of the day I people reach out to me and they're like bro I huge meals but if you only three huge meals a day then probably eating less than like six or seven medium size meals but if you want to put on size and you're struggling then yes you may need to eat until your own comfortably full like six or seven times a day
