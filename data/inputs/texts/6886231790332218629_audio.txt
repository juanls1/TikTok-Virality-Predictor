I'm going to go ahead and break down my three compound lifts from last Friday we started out here with back squat at 3:35 5:00 to 4:00 really trying to focus on putting those knees over toes driving the hips out keeping the upper body stable throughout the entirety of the lift and I wasn't able to put all the Reps in here because you know how to cut it short for the video but see their the knees are caving a little bit can't let that happen next up we have deficit deadlifts I did four sets of six on this add a little plate underneath the feet to add the two little inches really helps with leg drive out of the bottom and it's beneficial for your Squat and as well as the regular left I really enjoy these are adding more to my training last week we have front squat at 2:45 same thing here trying to keep those over Toes that hip drive out upper body's stable and just a really good leftovers I felt good about this day this guy walks in front of me here and then one of the trainers makes me laugh so I got a little distracted but oh well
