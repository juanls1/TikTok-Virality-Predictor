hello monkeys holy shit this one's going to be hard to Dwayne Johnson versus The Rock too fucking Titans going against each other you know man when I was younger I used to think they were the same person but how stupid of me anyways Dwayne Johnson versus The Rock is actually a really good matchup they both have the same type of body the same way the same power in their arms and legs and normally I would call it a stalemate but there's one difference between the Rock and Dwayne Johnson Dwayne Johnson is just a movie star the rock has 17 title wins which is 17 more than Dwayne Johnson has the rock is a 10 time world champion five-time tag team champion two-time Intercontinental Championship
