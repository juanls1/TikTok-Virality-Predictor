if you have knee pain such as when doing squats it is very likely that in this day and age due to all the city that everyone does that it's because you have tight quads and in particular your rectum this is a great stretch to loosen that muscle and your quad and hip flexor in general as you may have noticed I squeeze my glue to push my pelvis forward a little more which will further increase the stretch if you want to incorporate or emphasize the hip flexor more lean forward as I am here and if you want to focus on the quad more lean back and try to touch your butt to your heel
