I'm writing the bottom really absolutely a vote for Biden is a boat for the progressives do you actually like him it seems every year all I ever do is send to put a candidate that you don't like and ask you to set aside your values and vote for them anyway I don't think it's a really strong argument for putting in a president he's put forward some great policies seriously he's climate change idea isn't even close to the green New Deal wants to keep it Asylum Seekers out keep medical bills High encourage mass incarceration I mean what what deal is good will they put in good social programs for the poor yeah that's the trick up their sleeve isn't it they don't actually want to help the poor anywhere they just want to maintain their vote so every time that you encourage more social programs you'll continue to have their vote but that doesn't actually fix the problem of the pool now it does it it's just a vote winning tactic well he's not Trump that's not exactly a great argument well I'm sorry but you not changing my mind yeah I know
