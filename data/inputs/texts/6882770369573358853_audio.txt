hold on I just learned that show me all are like whole ass adults still telling your boyfriends that they're not allowed to like bikini photos on Instagram what if a man told me what I could or couldn't like on social media I would dump his controlling ass so you think your pictures are exempt from that the nerve dare I say the audacity baby girl if you want a guy who doesn't like someone's bikini photos because you find a disrespectful because you have insecurities that you haven't dealt with then fine go find one
