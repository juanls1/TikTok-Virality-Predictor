things that men can do to make a woman feel more comfortable will vary by the situation and by the woman but here's some things that men have done that have made me feel a lot more at ease whenever a man crosses to the other side of the street so he's not walking toward me or behind me at night it's also nice if I'm in public and there aren't a lot of people around and I see a man and he makes eye contact with me and gives me a little bit of a nod kind of letting me know he's aware of my presence and gives me a little bit of Space men will often use really crowded spaces as a way to touch a woman without her really knowing who it is and if I'm walking through a really narrow path that like a bar or even like in a congested Street and when I walk past the man he kind of puts his hands up for a second let me know he's not going to touch me the same can be said for class in your hands together and kind of putting them down in front of you and I got a question to ask is could I close the distance between me and this woman without anybody noticing or being able to help her and if the answer is yes just be extra aware of how she might feel
