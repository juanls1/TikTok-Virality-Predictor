b r o 86 alcarnus will cost you guys 4.3 million or 3.2 million if you got the trade price and it's a pretty nice looking bomber plane some cool things about this bomber plane is the fact that this plane can actually take off in about a second or two which is pretty cool this plane also comes with bombs but the bomb capacity on this plane is around 50 This Plane also has four engines which pretty much helps the playing go really quick a neat feature about this plane is the fact that when you're flying at a certain height you can go off the radar I only have two issues with this plane the first issue with this plane is the fact that it takes up so much space in your Hangar I mean look at this you guys can see that it removed all of my planes and literally it doesn't make any sense the second issue with this plane is whenever you request it in the interaction menu it always spawns it in the worst location I mean look at this I can't even take off properly without running into something
