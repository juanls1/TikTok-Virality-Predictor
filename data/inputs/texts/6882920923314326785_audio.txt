and it looks like 80% of my other meals and it got me thinking this is my study snack chicken rice low sugar ketchup and some carrots you don't have to be as Extreme as I am definitely not I've said before that I don't care what my food tastes like I just care what it does for me and I know not everyone can be that way however if you're not mentally disciplined or prepared enough to just suck it up and buy in and eat from a relatively smaller range of healthier foods for the most of your meals you can't really expect a ton of progress or success now that's not to say that eating healthy can't taste good but you can't take shortcuts so how bad do you want it don't get me wrong like hats you know I see guys but the majority of the work is going to be alright chicken steak sweet potato vegetables etcetera
