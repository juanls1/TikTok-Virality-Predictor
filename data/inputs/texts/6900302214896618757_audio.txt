so your question was what do GNC employees lie about well probably the biggest thing that we lie about is the pro membership being a deal for most people some people break even on it but almost nobody does I'm going to break that down for you real fast all right so what do we know we know that a Pro cost $40 we know that every dollar you spend as a loyalty member we know that 150 points you get five dollars back on a pro signs back for that transaction so if you spend $100 including the price of the pro you're going to get $10 back we know that you spent 40 on the pro so subtract 10 you got 30 bucks so 30.00 points so you have to spend another $900 to break even on the pro and if you want to make money on that I didn't even write it down I'm thinking about this right now but you got to spend another $150 on top of the 900 already spent to make money on your pro don't do it
