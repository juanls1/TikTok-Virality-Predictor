where do you put your belt during squats in deadlifts because I'm getting some bruising well keep in mind I actually use two different belts I use an STD belt for my squats because it is a half of your belt and I prefer setting it a little bit lower for some reason it's easier on my way and also keep in mind I've got a short shorter force of the most people but that's about where I like to set it during squats sassy belt like because it is a little bit of a loser belt and I prefer set because it allows me to get into a much better position that way and also I like having this loser position so yeah that's why I set my belts
