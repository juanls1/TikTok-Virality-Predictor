I've asked all my guy friends but I am super curious for an outside opinion when you are into a girl how often do you think about having sex with them and when you masturbate do you just think about them are you thinking about other girls too if you have girls that are friends do you think about sleeping with them or is that weird is that like a no-go for you all right be honest do you care for girl shaves do you want it to be fair trimmed are you okay do you really think that we are most beautiful when we don't have makeup on or would you prefer someone that puts a little bit of effort in how quickly do you know when you meet someone that you actually like them if a girl sleeps with you on the first date do you judge him he can't wait to hear your honest answers and if you're curious about what my opinion is on any of those questions hit me up in the comments
