first and foremost I'm glad that the guy who was benching is fine he posted the video he's laughing about it he's good as far as I know no punctured lungs from a cracked rib or anything he's good for the most part before anybody says anything about his spotter he actually did a good job of spotting I don't know about you but I don't like when people cover their hands above the bar just messes me up and the bar wasn't going in a downward motion so he had no reason to grab it early and one more thing I'm not sure if you guys notice this he was doing a homeless grip on bench and whatever you do that the chance of the bar slipping out of your hand especially if it has a very softly increases that much more just a quick PSA kids never do something on bench even though it might feel better
