so it seems that Tik Tok have a lot of people who believe they're experts within their field now guys bear in mind I've been lifting weights longer than this guy's been alive to be fair to the guy who makes one valid point which is if you use smaller plates that will help increase range of motion however he then goes and says that there's no right or wrong way to perform a T Bar row so guys whoever you follow make sure they're credible
