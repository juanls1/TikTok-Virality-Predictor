what's the craziest most realistic strength story you've ever heard I don't know dude people lie all the time but something I've witnessed in person was pretty crazy I thought this guy was bench pressing 484 lb which is 220 kilos five plates each and on the bench press this guy was a little bit bigger than me he wasn't that big it was weird so I'm looking at this like yeah you wish like what the fuck are you doing I'm kind of looking at it in the back of my I like on the mirror and he's got a spot and I'm thinking that guy spotting is going to get clapped like this is going to be a scene anyway the guy ended up banging out like three to five reps I can't remember how many reps but it was like three to five reps absolutely it was just saying this guy was did not look like he could lift that much weight so that was pretty insane so well done to that guy I'm assuming he would have been running some crazy shit
