what's up man honestly your form is super super solid and actually looks pretty good couple things I work on is remember to keep your shoulder blades squeeze back cuz I know that's how you squeeze them back and as soon as you start pulling you kind of unsee them and everything to work on is work on a little hip mobility it looks like you need to get down a little bit more to get in a better position and remember to keep your butt down cuz I could see you picking up just a little bit before you would start the whole movement great work and keep pushing yourself dude
