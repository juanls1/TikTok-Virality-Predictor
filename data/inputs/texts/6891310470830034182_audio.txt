if she doesn't remember the original formula of Jack 3D or Jack I really never knew how to pronounce it she's too young for you bro long story short they have sins had to change the formula of the supplement because it contained dimethylamylamine or dmaa as most commonly known but if you do any research on dmaa it is a banned substance in pretty much all sports and it's also illegal this is just a quick article from WebMD if you just type WebMD and dmaa into Google then you will be able to pull up the article but if you ever took anything with dmaa in it and believe me I did this is way before I get any research and supplements I just saw it on YouTube this is going to make me feel like I can run through a wall so let me buy it let me tell you when he absorbed the god tree I can't tell anybody not to take anything but just do your research people have died taking stuff that contained dmaa
