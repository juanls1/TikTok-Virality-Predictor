so recently I've had some people reach out to ask me for my bicep workout and I'm not going to lie to you by the development is kind of always come easily to me I guess it just kind of has some favorable insertions and the shapes kind of always been there for me so I'm not going to say that the way that I train my biceps is the reason that they look like they do however I can still provide some tips to help facilitate your bicep development so for starters you can't actually isolate a specific area of a single muscle but you can emphasize specific areas of a muscle would that being said to emphasize the inside of the bicep or that area here which will help with the appearance of like for example doing in front of you as well these are just some examples of some exercises that I've been doing as of late to accomplish that alternatively you can use cables or anything that's really applying resistance position like this
