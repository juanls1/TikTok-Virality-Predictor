so I really wasn't going to reply to this comment because your thoughts and ideas about my body doesn't affect me and doesn't bother me but as the body positivity movement is kind of like a big thing right now your thoughts and ideas about a perfect woman is not how every woman is going to look and so keeping your thoughts and ideas to yourself is just so much better than commenting on people's videos God gave me this body the way it is to use it well and so far I've used it to be a two sport division one athlete through college and track and play basketball so I really don't feel like you know having bigger boobs would have helped me or would help me in any way shape or form in my life at this point so you know maybe like not commenting rude things on people's videos would be a great idea thanks bye
